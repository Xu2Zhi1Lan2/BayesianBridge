Description: Providing an advanced suite of tools for performing Bayesian Bridge 
    Regression and Bayesian Normal Mean estimation. It offers efficient algorithms 
    for modeling and inference, notably through a Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs 
    sampler with an adapted step size, specifically designed to handle linear regression 
    contexts with high dimensions with p>n. The Bayesian Bridge Regression module 
    allows for sophisticated handling of regularization issues by adjusting for both 
    shrinkage and selection, with the ability to sample from joint posterior distributions 
    of coefficients and model hyperparameters. Compared to other traditional Bayesian 
    Bridge Regression packages, this method addresses more potential issues of convergence.
